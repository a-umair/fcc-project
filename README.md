## Background
Finding myself in possession of a newly minted domain name, and at the brink of installing WordPress, I realized it would be so much more fun to actually code [my website](https://uma1r.com) from scratch. Having worked a little on fCC two years ago, but having gotten sidetracked since, I decided to start from the beginning and document my journey here. Given the iterative nature of the freeCodeCamp coding challenges and projects, with new concepts introduced in separate modules, I find fCC to lend itself nicely to a 'git commit'-esque mode of documentation.

## Thoughts
**12/28/2018** - It has been a fascinating journey so far learning to craft a visually palatable web-page, ensuring a given page is responsive, intuitive to navigate, and has a palatable color scheme, with that last condition being more difficult to check off than I had initially thought. So far, I've worked through HTML/HTML5 basics, CSS basics, and am currently working through the 'Applied Visual Design' section, having learned about the various methods for positioning elements, boxy element shadows, color theory, and linear color gradients.
