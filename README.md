## About Me
I am a CS senior in college with little web development experience, so given the iterative nature of the freeCodeCamp coding challenges and projects, I decided it would be fun to tackle the freeCodeCamp curriculum in my spare time. I'm using this repository to hold myself publicly accountable.

## About freeCodeCamp.org
freeCodeCamp needs no introduction since nearly every developer has likely heard of it by now, but for the uninitiated:-

> "Founded by Quincy Larson in October 2014, freeCodeCamp is a non-profit organization that consists of an interactive learning web platform, an online community forum, chat rooms, Medium publications and local organizations that intend to make learning web development accessible to anyone."

## Thoughts
**12/28/2018** - It has been a fascinating journey so far learning to craft a visually palatable web-page, ensuring a given page is responsive, intuitive to navigate, and has a palatable color scheme, with that last condition being more difficult to check off than I had initially thought. So far, I've worked through HTML/HTML5 basics, CSS basics, and am currently working through the 'Applied Visual Design' section, having learned about the various methods for positioning elements, boxy element shadows, color theory, and linear color gradients.
