# About Me
I was a CS senior in college with little web development experience, so given the iterative nature of the freeCodeCamp modules and projects, I decided it would be fun to tackle the freeCodeCamp curriculum in my spare time. I'm using this repository to hold myself publicly accountable.

# About freeCodeCamp.org
freeCodeCamp needs no introduction since nearly every developer has likely heard of it by now, but for the uninitiated:-

> "Founded by Quincy Larson in October 2014, freeCodeCamp is a non-profit organization that consists of an interactive learning web platform, an online community forum, chat rooms, Medium publications and local organizations that intend to make learning web development accessible to anyone."
